# FoodApp - A Manifest-powered Restaurant Management App

This is a complete React application built with Manifest as its backend. It allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their own restaurants.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login for restaurant owners.
- **Restaurant Management**: Full CRUD capabilities for restaurants, with ownership enforced by backend policies.
- **Manifest-Powered**: All backend logic, database, and APIs are auto-generated by Manifest.
- **Manifest SDK**: The frontend communicates exclusively through the type-safe `@mnfst/sdk`.
- **Admin Panel**: A complete admin interface is automatically available at `/admin` for managing all data.
- **Responsive UI**: A clean, modern interface built with Tailwind CSS.
